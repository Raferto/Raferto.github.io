It is located on a delta island near the junction of the Barito and Martapura rivers.Banjarmasin is sometimes called the "City of Thousand River" or "Kota Seribu Sungai" in Indonesian, even though it the river in Banjarmasin does not reach 1000. It was called like that because there was many river about hundred or so (at least it used to be), and people doesn't want to count all of them, so they just said thousand. But Still there used to be river anywhere in Banjarmasin, it was said the river connect the city, it was proven by the fact that, long time ago the main transportation was a small boat called "Jukung", but now it was just a traditional transportation. So yeah, Kalimantan Island is not just a Forest.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Nan Serunai was an ancient kingdom in South Kalimantan, but soon it was replaced by Buddhist kingdom of Tanjungpuri. In the fourteenth century, Banjarmasin was part of the Hindu kingdoms of Negara Dipa and Negara Daha, a vassal of Majapahit. But Pangeran Samudera converted to become a Muslim in the fifteenth century. Following this Banjarmasin was founded at the junction of the Barito and Martapura Rivers on 24 September 1526. The Dutch opened trade there in 1606. The British controlled the city for several brief periods. The British East India Company (EIC) started trading with the city, which they called Tamborneo or Tomborneo, in 1614. In 1703 the EIC established a factory there, which the inhabitants destroyed four years later. The EIC attempted, highly unsuccessfully, to trade with the city between 1736 and 1746, and then in 1747 the Sultan signed a treaty with the Dutch giving them a trade monopoly.</p>
                <p>In 1787 it became a Dutch protectorate. Banjarmasin remained the region's capital until the onset of the Banjarmasin War in 1859, when the Dutch headquarters were moved to Martapura.</p>
                <p>The Hikayat Banjar is the chronicle of Banjarmasin. This text, also called the History of Lambung Mangkurat, contains the history of the kings of Banjar and of Kota Waringin in South-east and South Borneo respectively.</p>
                <p>In 1930 the city's population was 66,000 and reached 444,000 in 1990</p>
                <p>Banjarmasin was the capital of Dutch Borneo. It was therefore an objective for the Japanese during Japanese Occupation of Indonesia during World War II. Banjarmasin was occupied on 10 February 1942.</p>
